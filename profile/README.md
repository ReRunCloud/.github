ReRunCloud is a group of passionate developers that aims to (hopefully) develop our own implementation of [RunCloud](https://runcloud.io) that aims to fix the possible shortcomings of their implementation.

Our aim is to develop our own RunCloud based on the implementation that is publicly accessible through RunCloud panel and nothing else: it should be public-facing ONLY.

We strive to ensure feature parity with the project (and possibly adding our own) and provide it as an open-source solution for others to be able to contribute!
